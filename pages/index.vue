					Our mission at Husky Roboticsâ€™ is to provide UW students with an environment where they
					can learn practical, hands-on engineering skills as part of a large interdisciplinary
					team. Unfettered by the time limits of the quarter system, our members build on their
					skills for the entire year, working in a project-oriented team where they can see how
					their work becomes part of the complete system. This fosters better communication skills,
					and a fuller understanding of modern engineering.
