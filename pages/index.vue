				Our mission at Husky Roboticsâ€™ is to provide UW students with an environment where they can
				learn practical, hands-on engineering skills as part of a large interdisciplinary team.
				Unfettered by the time limits of the quarter system, our members build on their skills for
				the entire year, working in a project-oriented team where they can see how their work
				becomes part of the complete system. This fosters better communication skills, and a fuller
				understanding of modern engineering.
