name: Business Subsystem
description: The Business team ensures the continuity of Husky Robotics. In charge of raising funds and managing the budget, business team members need to understand the needs of each subsystem and work with the leads to get all necessary parts ordered and delivered in a timely manner. The business team members also present Husky Robotics to the UW and external organizations, corporations, and media outlets, creating content to promote the team, seek sponsorships and outreach opportunities, and try to assist team members in finding internships. Business team members are encouraged to join other subsystems.
