  "name": "Arm Subsystem",
  "description": "The Arm subsystem is responsible for the design and construction of the chassis-mounted rover arm module. The arm must be capable of lifting up to 5 kg and should be dexterous enough to pick up tools, perform actions on a control panel, and type on a keyboard.  Members of this subsystem learn to design with CAD programs, use the machine shop to manufacture parts, and perform maintenance. The Arm subsystem works closely with the Software subsystem to develop inverse kinematic control algorithms for ergonomic control of the arm and claw, as well as with the Electronics subsystem to ensure clear paths for wires and sufficient connection durability.",
