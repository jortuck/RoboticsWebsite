name: Instrumentation Subsystem
description: The Instrumentation subsystem is responsible for designing and building the Instrumentation Station, a module for the rover that collects and analyzes soil samples as part of the instrumentation task. The instrumentation station is required to provide information about soil temperature and water content, and the team also chooses other relevant sensors, such as UV exposure and onboard microscope help during site selection and the presentation. The team also chooses and develops a set of off-rover tests such as X-ray spectroscopy, free amine Ninhydrin tests, and pH. The Instrumentation subsystem needs members capable of CAD modeling, part manufacturing, extensive electronic and software design, and doing background research in astrogeology and astrobiology. It's a great subsystem to join to get a bit of experience in every field of robotics.
