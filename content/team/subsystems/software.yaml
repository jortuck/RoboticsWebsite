name: Software Subsystem
description: The Software subsystem creates the brains of the rover, allowing it to be operated when it is out of sight of the driver. The Software subsystem works with drive algorithms, inverse kinematics, artificial intelligence, and interfacing with different controllers to make sure the rover operates quickly and intuitively for the driver. The subsystem also creates the user interface used to drive the rover including camera feeds, on-screen controls for precision-based operations such as working with the science system, and map-based coordinate plotting.
