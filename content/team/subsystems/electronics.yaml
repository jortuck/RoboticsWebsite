name: Electronics Subsystem
description: Electronics members will assume the role of either hardware engineer or firmware developer. Our hardware engineers will simulate circuits, design, and produce printed circuit boards. Firmware engineers will write embedded C code to run these boards. We have boards for power distribution, controlling motors, and reading sensor input. All boards communicate with a central Linux board. One firmware and one hardware engineer will be paired up and together have sole responsibility for bringing up their board.
