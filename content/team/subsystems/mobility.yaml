name: Mobility Subsystem
description: The Mobility subsystem creates a vehicle capable of traveling over the rough terrain of the Martian (Utah) surface while providing stable mounting points for the arm and instrumentation station. This team works extensively with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software to create a digital rendering of the rover during the fall quarter, selecting parts and consulting with the other subsystems to have the design ready to build in winter. During the winter quarter, the Mobility subsystem members primarily work to manufacture the base of the rover. The Spring quarter is devoted to mechanical fine-tuning, the creation of spare parts, and maintenance practice for the competition.
